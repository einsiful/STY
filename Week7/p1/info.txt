first of all, i really like doing this assigments but i think for now and has been for past assigments
that i am spending more time of trying to understand the assigments, and try to figure out what you are asking me about.
Like for this assigment, that i had to use Excel to make graphs and all that and this dont work on mac and this dont work on linux
or it only works on linux and this only works on windows. this is really frustrating and also that the information is just everywhere.
like on Discord and on Piazza. i cant find nothing on piazza and sometimes people are saying things on discord and not on discord.

I think that the assigments are really good and i like doing them but i it gets really frustrating when i have to make some graphs and this dont work
on mac and this only works on linux, this course is already really hard and it is not helping that i have to spend more time on trying to figure out
how to do the assigments than actually doing the assigments.

okey but the assigment.
i coded the measure_tlb and i finally got the results that i was looking for.
but then the part of the assigment that it dont work on mac or i have to do this and that to make it work on mac.
or on linux, like was really stuck on the make command, it did not work and i have been spending alot of time on that then i figured out,
but i think that is not the point of the assigment. and then i had to copy it on my mac and it says it dont work with amd or something and then i just gave up.
it dosent make sense to me.

I am really sorry for this but i am really frustrated and i am really trying to do my best and i am really trying to understand the assigments and i am really trying to do them.

Kind regards
